# PRD: [Feature Name]

## Overview
Brief description of the PCB feature and its purpose.

## Problem Statement
What PCB design/automation problem does this solve?

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Specific PCB manipulation functionality

### Performance Requirements  
- Speed, memory, scalability for large PCBs

### Compatibility Requirements
- KiCAD version compatibility
- File format preservation needs

## Design Considerations
### API Design
- Integration with PCBBoard class
- New methods and interfaces

### Algorithm Approach
- Placement/routing/analysis algorithms
- Performance optimization strategies

### Manufacturing Impact
- Effect on DRC, Gerber generation
- Pick-and-place file implications

## Success Criteria
- Measurable improvements (trace length, placement efficiency)
- Compatibility validation with KiCAD

## Dependencies
- Required footprint libraries
- External tool integrations (Freerouting, KiCAD CLI)

## Timeline
- Implementation phases and milestones
