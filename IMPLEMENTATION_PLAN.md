- **Geometric Systems**: Bounding box calculations, Manhattan routing with obstacle avoidance
- **Format Preservation**: Exact S-expression handling maintaining byte-perfect output

**Key API Patterns:**
- Fluent interfaces with chainable operations
- Object-oriented design with meaningful return values
- Component search by reference, value, regex patterns
- Pin-to-pin connectivity with automatic position calculation
- Hierarchical design support with multi-sheet workflows

**Implementation Philosophy:**
- Exact format preservation through careful S-expression parsing
- Position tolerance configurations (0.05mm default)
- Comprehensive element removal with automatic cleanup
- MCP server integration for AI agent deployment

| Phase 4: Zones | 2-3 weeks | Phase 1 |
| Phase 5: Graphics | 2-3 weeks | Phase 1 |
| Phase 6: Placement | 3-4 weeks | Phase 2 |
| Phase 7: Design Rules | 3-4 weeks | Phase 3 |
| Phase 8: Manufacturing | 2-3 weeks | Phase 7 |
| Phase 9: MCP Server | 2-3 weeks | Phase 2, 3 |
| Phase 10: Documentation | 2-3 weeks | All phases |

**Parallel Development Opportunities:**
- Phases 4 and 5 can run in parallel
- Documentation (Phase 10) should run continuously
- Testing should be ongoing throughout all phases

**MVP Milestone:** After Phase 1 + Phase 2 (7-10 weeks)
- Core collections and footprint operations
- Can be used for basic PCB creation and manipulation

**Production Ready:** After Phase 7 (20-28 weeks)
- Full routing, placement, and DRC
- Suitable for automated PCB generation

## 11. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)

1. **Set up development environment**
   - Configure development dependencies
   - Set up testing framework with pytest
   - Configure code quality tools (black, mypy, pre-commit)

2. **Create collection base classes**
   - Implement `BaseCollection` abstract class
   - Create `FootprintCollection` with basic operations
   - Add tests for collection behavior

3. **Enhance parser robustness**
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Test with various KiCAD PCB files
   - Document parsing limitations

4. **Start documentation**
   - Set up documentation structure
   - Write architecture overview
   - Create API design documents

### Week 3-4: First Deliverable

- **Goal:** Functional FootprintCollection with search
- **Deliverables:**
  - FootprintCollection class with add/remove/search
  - Tests covering collection operations
  - Documentation for collection API
  - Example demonstrating collection usage

### Long-term Milestones

## 12. Appendix

### A. KiCAD PCB File Format Examples

**Minimal PCB:**
```lisp
(kicad_pcb
  (version 20241229)
  (generator "pcbnew")
  (general (thickness 1.6))
  (paper "A4")
  (layers
    (0 "F.Cu" signal)
    (2 "B.Cu" signal)
  )
  (setup
    (pad_to_mask_clearance 0)
  )
  (net 0 "")
)
```

**Footprint Example:**
```lisp
(footprint "Resistor_SMD:R_0603_1608Metric"
  (layer "F.Cu")
  (tstamp "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc")
  (at 100 50)
  (property "Reference" "R1" (at 0 -1.5) (layer "F.SilkS"))
  (property "Value" "10k" (at 0 1.5) (layer "F.Fab"))
  (path "/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc")
  (attr smd)
  (pad "1" smd roundrect (at -0.825 0) (size 0.8 0.95) (layers "F.Cu" "F.Paste" "F.Mask"))
  (pad "2" smd roundrect (at 0.825 0) (size 0.8 0.95) (layers "F.Cu" "F.Paste" "F.Mask"))
)
```

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing **kicad-pcb-api** into a production-quality library matching the success of **kicad-sch-api**. The phased approach allows for incremental delivery while maintaining focus on core functionality first.

The estimated 6-9 month timeline is realistic given the scope, with an MVP achievable in 2-3 months. Success depends on:

1. **Maintaining architectural consistency** with kicad-sch-api patterns
2. **Rigorous testing** including format preservation and real-world PCBs
3. **Community engagement** for feedback and contributions
4. **Continuous documentation** throughout development
5. **Phased delivery** to provide value early and often

The resulting library will enable:
- Automated PCB generation from code
- CI/CD workflows for PCB validation
- AI agent integration for intelligent PCB design
- Batch processing of PCB modifications
- Custom EDA tool development

This positions kicad-pcb-api as the go-to solution for programmatic KiCAD PCB manipulation, complementing kicad-sch-api to provide complete circuit design automation.
